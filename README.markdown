RubyMine Color Schemes
=======

Howto
-------
Copy the xml file or clone this repository into your RubyMine preferences directory. It's super-easy! Then edit and customize as you'd like. 

Select the scheme at IDE Settings | Editor | Colors & Fonts. If you expand the Colors & Fonts group you can choose background colors and styles for the many supported languages and styles. 

For more schemes, check the 'old' official list. at 
http://devnet.jetbrains.net/docs/DOC-1154

Copy the xml file here:

      ~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine31/colors/

or do a 

      git clone git://github.com/oma/RubyMine-Scheme.git .

in the colors directory (create it if it doesn't exist). If you have a different RubyMine version, use that one.
